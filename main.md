# Digital Tibetan

Welcome to the DigitalTibetan v3.0

_The Project is in a very early stage._

```{note}
This site will become in time the successor for the old DigitalTibetan v2.0 Mediawiki site.
An archived version of the old site is still available at [archive.org DigitalTibetan](https://web.archive.org/web/20210502044931/http://www.digitaltibetan.org/index.php/Digital_Tibetan)
```

## The new scope of Digital Tibetan

Digital Tibetan wants to cater two target audiences:

- Much like the [predecessor version](https://web.archive.org/web/20210502044931/http://www.digitaltibetan.org/index.php/Digital_Tibetan) of DigitalTibetan, this site aspires to collect information and How-Tos on how to work with digital Tibetan information within the context of one's own hardware and setup. [Start here.](docs/devices_tibetan.md)
- Additionally the plan is to introduce tools for [computational dharma](docs/computational_dharma.ipynb), how modern tools inherited from data science can be used to efficiently create personal working environments that support working with, cross-referencing, and transforming large amounts of natural language data related to Tibetan. 

## Contribution, suggestions and corrections

This site is based on a [github repository](https://github.com/DigitalTibetan/DigitalTibetan) that basically consists of simple text-files in markdown. The markdown files are converted into this web site using [Jupyter-Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/index.html).

- For corrections, small additions or suggestions, please use the [Github issues](https://github.com/DigitalTibetan/DigitalTibetan/issues)
- For larger contributions, [Github pull-requests](https://github.com/DigitalTibetan/DigitalTibetan/pulls) are welcome!
