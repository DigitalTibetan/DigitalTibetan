# Digital Tibetan

Welcome to the DigitalTibetan v3.0

```{warning}
The Project is in a very early stage.

**URLs will still change!**
```

```{note}
This site will become in time the successor for the old DigitalTibetan v2.0 Mediawiki site.
An archived version of the old site is still available at [archive.org DigitalTibetan](https://web.archive.org/web/20210502044931/http://www.digitaltibetan.org/index.php/Digital_Tibetan)
```

**Contribute!** Simply select the Github-icon ( on of the icons on the top-right) and 'suggest an edit'. No worries, you can't break things, since each edit will be reviewed before going life. For more details see [Contribution](contribute) below.

## The new scope of Digital Tibetan

Digital Tibetan wants to cater two target audiences:

- Much like the [predecessor version](https://web.archive.org/web/20210502044931/http://www.digitaltibetan.org/index.php/Digital_Tibetan) of DigitalTibetan, this site aspires to collect information and How-Tos on how to work with digital Tibetan information within the context of one's own hardware and setup. [Start here.](docs/devices_tibetan.md)
- Additionally the plan is to introduce tools for [computational dharma](docs/computational_dharma.ipynb), how modern tools inherited from data science can be used to efficiently create personal working environments that support working with, cross-referencing, and transforming large amounts of natural language data related to Tibetan.

The Github-icon on the top right gives easy access to the source-repository and has a quick-edit option. Each edit will be reviewed, so there is no danger of generating a mess. Documents use the [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) format.

This site is based on a [github repository](https://github.com/DigitalTibetan/DigitalTibetan) that basically consists of simple text-files in markdown. The markdown files are converted into this web site using [Jupyter-Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/index.html).

- For corrections, small additions or suggestions, please use the [Github issues](https://github.com/DigitalTibetan/DigitalTibetan/issues)
- For larger contributions, [Github pull-requests](https://github.com/DigitalTibetan/DigitalTibetan/pulls) are welcome!
