# How to configure Android mobiles


```{warning}
Installing a third-party keyboard on Android is a significant security risk! Do not install keyboard from unknown or untrusted sources. Once a keyboard is installed, the producer of that keyboard has basically potentially access to everything you do on your mobile device.

Android comes with Tibetan fonts preinstalled. In order to work with Tibetan, simply add a Tibetan keyboard.

The recommended keyboard is Google's Gboard Keyboard that allows adding a vast array of different input methods.

Once `gboard` is installed, go to `Settings`, `System`, `Languages and input` and select the `Gboard` keyboard.

In `Add a language`, select `‡Ωñ‡Ωº‡Ωë‡ºã‡Ω¶‡æê‡Ωë‡ºã` (Tibetan) and select the preferred sub-type, `‡Ω¢‡æí‡æ±‡ºã‡ΩÇ‡Ω¢‡ºã` (India) or `‡Ω¢‡æí‡æ±‡ºã‡Ωì‡ΩÇ‡ºã` (China).

Now, using the globe (üåê) icon on the on-screen keyboard, you can switch between different input methods.

There are two ways to stack, start from top, and any letter that should be stacked below can be entered by long-press or via `<shift>`. E.g. to enter ‡Ω¢‡æí‡æ±‡Ω¥, press `‡Ω¢`, (long-press)`‡ΩÇ`, (long-press)`‡Ω°`, and `‡Ω¥`. Alternatively use `<shift>` instead of long-pressing the letters.
