# An overview of different Tibetan keyboards

```{warning}
Keyboards are a primary attack vector on computer integrity. Never, ever install keyboards from unvalidated sources, neither on computer nor on mobile.
```
Unfortunately there is no single system or standard that's available on all platforms.

## Microsoft Tibetan keyboard: `Tibetan (PRC)`

Available on Linux too, `Tibetan (PRC)` stems from some initial efforts to standardize Tibetan keyboards.

The following article describes the keyboard and it's history well:

- <http://www.yalasoo.com/English/docs/yalasoo_en_MStbKb.html>

Unfortunately, Apple did not adopt this standardization effort.


[^mondist]: Many mirrors of the monlam installers are circulating, some of them infected with compromising viruses.
[^gboard]: While the Gboard app is available for iOS too, the Tibetan keyboard is not included on iOS.
[^tibq]: The iOS Tibetan keyboard mirrors the layout of Apple macOS's `Tibetan QWERTY` keyboard.
