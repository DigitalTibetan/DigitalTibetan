## I want to get a new mobile, what's best?

Since both major platforms, Google's Android and Apple's iOS fully support Tibetan, it's mostly a matter of taste which platform is preferred.

* Generally **Android is more open** and easier to customize to more complex applications. If you plan to have maximum possibilities, go with Android.
* Slightly **easier** to use for some people are **Apple iOS** devices (iPhone, iPad). This comes at the cost of fewer degrees of freedom: Installing your own content, fonts and cross-application interoperability is considerably hampered when compared to Android.

For most people, the actual difference between Android and iOS do not matter.

Unfortunately most **e-ink ebook readers** are not particularly well suited for Tibetan. Amazon Kindle has completely **broken Tibetan** support, so those cannot be used. Some ebook manufacturers (e.g. PocketBook) offer some degree of Tibetan support, but it is still rather limited when compared with Android or iOS devices. Not recommended.

#### Footnotes

[^1]: iOS currently has a bug that sometimes duplicates stacked Tibetan letters during input with Apple's implementation of the Wylie import method. The duplicate letters vanish as soon as a complete syllable is entered. Apple has so far been unable to fix this.
[^2]: Older kindle models (before operating system update 5.9.6) did correctly display Tibetan script. Current version have broken the support for Tibetan. Amazon has so far been unable to fix this.
