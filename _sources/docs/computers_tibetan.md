# Computers and Tibetan script

All current computers and operating system support working with Tibetan script. Worst contender is Windows that has no built-in input method for Wylie.

| Computer type | Tibetan display  | Input methods  | development |
| ------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| [macOS](computers_macos.md)         |    + +           |   + +          |   + +       |
| [Windows](computers_windows.md)       |    + +           |   o[^1]        |   +         |
| [Linux KDE](computers_linux_kde.md)     |    + +           |   + +          |   + + +     |
| [Linux Gnome](computers_linux_gnome.d)   |    + +           |   + +          |   + + +     |

[^1]: Windows does not come with a Wylie input method. It's the only major operating system that does not support Wylie input at operating system level. Support hinges on third-party tools with uncertain long-term availability. Especially support for new hardware platforms is uncertain.

## I want to work with Tibetan texts, what's the best choice for a new computer?

* [Working with macOS](computers_macos.md): The best overall choice for most people is a macOS laptop: everything that's needed to work with Tibetan is already part of the operating system macOS: Tibetan fonts, Sanskrit fonts, input methods for Tibetan and Sanskrit diacritics are built in, and only some simple configuration steps are required to activate everything that's needed.

* Working with Linux [KDE](computers_linux_kde.md) or [Gnome](computers_linux_gnome.md): For those who are technically well versed, Linux is the best choice: Linux hardware is available at lower cost, and the possibilites, especially, if natural language processing or [computational dharma](docs/computational_dharma.md) are areas of interest, Linux (KDE or Gnome is just a matter of taste) is an even better choice. The trade-off is the higher technical complexity.

* [Working with Windows](computers_windows.md): For every body else: Windows it will be. There are two drawbacks: a Wylie input method is only available via a third-party plug-in that has last been updated around 2012, and it's uncertain if it will continue to work with newer versions of windows. If the focus might be on computational dharma, then Windows is the worst choice as platform, posing more obstacles to getting things working than either macOS or Linux. <br>Still, as of now it is perfectly possible to work with Windows computers and Tibetan texts.
