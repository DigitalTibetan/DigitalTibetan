# Working with macOS and Tibetan script

The Mac comes with Tibetan fonts preinstalled. For more fonts, see [Tibetan fonts](tibetan_fonts.md).

 To activate a Tibetan keyboard, start `System Preferences` and select `Keyboard`, `Input Sources`. Press the `+`-Icon (marked in red in the image) and add the `Tibetan - Wylie` keyboard.

Make sure that `Show Input menu in menu bar` is enabled so that you can easily switch keyboards by clicking the input-menu icon in the menu bar.

Newer Mac hardware keyboards have a globe icon üåê that can be used to switch between the Tibetan keyboard and your usual keyboard. If that's not the case, consider assigning the `CAPS LOCK` key to switch between the keyboards (see green marker in image).

### Chose a keyboard-switcher hotkey

You can assign an arbitrary hotkey to switch between the keyboards: In `System Preferences`, `Keyboard`, select `Shortcuts` and `Input Sources`. There either enable the suggested shortcut, or click on the proposed shortcut to enter a new key-combination.

## Activating the Tibetan keyboard

You should now be able to either select the current keyboard by hotkey, or by clicking the input-source icon in the menu bar.
