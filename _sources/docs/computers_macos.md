# macOS and Tibetan script

Tibetan support works equally well for old Intel Macs and the new Apple Silicon based Macs.

## Fonts

The Mac comes with Tibetan fonts preinstalled. 

| Font name | Sample | Glyphs | Comment |
| --------- | :----: | ------ | ------- |
| Kailasa   | ![macOS Kailasa](Images/Font_Kailasa.jpg) | 1.393 | Version 16.0d1e1, by Otani University Shin Buddhist Research Institute |
| Kokonor | ![macOS Kokonor](Images/Font_Kokonor.jpg) | 1.344 | Version 13.0d1e3, Otani University Shin Buddhist Research Institute |

Both fonts have a very limited glyph count, are not under a free license, and are only available on macOS.

For alternative fonts, see [Tibetan fonts](tibetan_fonts.md).

## Tibetan keyboard

 To activate a Tibetan keyboard, start `System Preferences` and select `Keyboard`, `Input Sources`. Press the `+`-Icon (marked in red in the image) and add the `Tibetan - Wylie` keyboard.

 ```{image} Images/macos_input_source_select.jpg

 ```

Make sure that `Show Input menu in menu bar` is enabled so that you can easily switch keyboards by clicking the input-menu icon in the menu bar.

Newer Mac hardware keyboards have a globe icon üåê that can be used to switch between the Tibetan keyboard and your usual keyboard. 

```{warning}
macOS implementation of Wylie is currently quite broken. The `<shift>`-key to access Sanskrit variants doesn't work currently, and one needs to use `CAPS LOCK` to access those. Additionally, the `=` is used as non-standard stacking-key. So make sure that `CAPS LOCK` is not assigned to other functionality, like switching input methods.
```

### Chose a keyboard-switcher hotkey

You can assign an arbitrary hotkey to switch between the keyboards: In `System Preferences`, `Keyboard`, select `Shortcuts` and `Input Sources`. There either enable the suggested shortcut, or click on the proposed shortcut to enter a new key-combination.

## Activating the Tibetan keyboard

You should now be able to either select the current keyboard by hotkey, or by clicking the input-source icon in the menu bar.

## How to type Tibetan Wylie EWTS

For an overview how Tibetan is transliterated as Wylie, checkout [Wikipedia Wylie transliteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wylie_transliteration).

Some easy examples with `Tibetan - Wylie` keyboard enabled:

- to type ‡Ω¶‡Ω∫‡Ωò‡Ω¶‡ºã‡ΩÖ‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ωê‡Ωò‡Ω¶‡ºã‡ΩÖ‡Ωë‡ºç, type `sems can thams cad/`
- to type ‡Ω¢‡æí‡æ±‡Ω¥‡ºã, simply type `rgyu `
- ‡ΩÇ‡Ω°‡Ω¥ is `g.yu`, ‡ΩÇ‡æ±‡Ω¥ is `gyu`.

Since macOS Wylie input method is Wylie in name-only, it makes sense to activate the `Show Keyboard Viewer` in the input selector menu-bar icon.

The `Caps lock` key makes Sanskrit and special symbols available, while the `=` key supports non-standard stacking.
It might be necessary to experiment a bit with the keyboard viewer active.

Here are the special layouts:

After selecting `caps-lock`:

after selecting `caps-lock` and `=`:

:width: 320
```

after selcting `caps-lock`, `=`, and `caps-lock`:
```{image} Images/macos_keyboard_viewer_caps_=_caps.jpg
:width: 320
```

Some examples:

- So currently, to type ‡Ωå‡æú‡æ∑‡Ω≤, one types `<caps lock> d = d = <caps lock> h i`. 
- ‡ºÑ‡ºÖ‡ºç  ‡ºç is `<caps lock> 2 3 <caps lock> / <caps lock> <space> <space> <caps lock> /`
- ‡Ω®‡Ωº‡Ωæ‡ºã‡Ω®‡Ω±‡Ωø‡Ωß‡Ω±‡Ω¥‡Ωæ‡ºî is `o <caps lock> m <caps lock> <space> <caps lock> ah <caps lock> h <caps lock> um :`

Not _quite_ the standard way to do things...

## Sanskrit diacritics

Working with dharma materials often requires access to diacritics. For those who are using an English QWERTY layout, the Apple keyboard `ABC - Extended` provides easy access to virtually all diacritics imaginable, including IAST Sanskrit transliteration. Install this keyboard from `System Preferences`, `Keyboard`, `Input Sources` and add the `ABC - Extended` keyboard just as you did with the Tibetan keyboard.

```
Some examples for Sanskrit:

Note: `‚å•` is the **right** option key, it is always the first key in diacritics sequences with the `ABC - Extended ` keyboard. Again, enable `Show Keyboard Viewer` in the input-method selector in the menu bar, and as soon as the right option key `‚å•` is pressed, all available diacritics are shown.
