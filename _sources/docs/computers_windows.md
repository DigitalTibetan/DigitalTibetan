## Windows Tibetan fonts

Windows comes with a Tibetan font that has a very unusual property: it can render arbitrary complex Tibetan stacks (e.g. Sanskrit mantras) 'on the fly' without the requirement that a specific glyph is already part of the font. 

| Font name | Sample | Glyphs | Comment |
| --------- | :----: | ------ | ------- |
| Microsoft Himalaya | ![Microsoft Himalaya](Images/Font_Himalaya.jpg) | unlimited | Only font that can synthesize arbitrary stacks, works only on Windows |

Example:

![Kālacakra](Images/Himalaya_Kalacakra.jpg)

Unusual stacks as in this Kālacakra mantra are no problem for Microsoft Himalaya.
