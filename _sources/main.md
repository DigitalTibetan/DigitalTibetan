# Digital Tibetan

Welcome to the Digital Tibetan v3.0

## The new home of Digital Tibetan v3.0

- This site is a collection of information and How-Tos on how to work with digital Tibetan information. For information on how to configure mobiles and computer for Tibetan fonts, [start here](docs/devices_tibetan.md). This site is a new version of the old DigitalTibetan wiki[^ref_old_site], and it is currently still under development.
- Additionally, the plan is to introduce tools for [computational dharma](docs/computational_dharma.ipynb), how modern tools inherited from data science can be used to efficiently create personal working environments that support working with, cross-referencing, and transforming large amounts of natural language data related to Tibetan.

## News

- 2022-10-04: A new conversion tool for PDFs using old Tibetan fonts is being [made available](https://github.com/buda-base/py-tiblegenc) by Elie Roux. Text within PDFs created with non-Unicode Tibetan fonts is difficult to recover, and this tool helps to extract the original Tibetan typing in modern Unicode encoding. Development is ongoing, and the sources are available at [Python Tibetan Legacy Encodings tool](https://github.com/buda-base/py-tiblegenc) at github. More conversion tools can be found at [Tibetan Pre-Unicode](docs/tibetan_pre_unicode.md).
- See the [news archive](docs/news/_news_archive.md) for what was previously news.

If topics are missing, or you have suggestions on how to improve the site, please use the github:

- For corrections, small additions or suggestions, please use the [Github issues](https://github.com/DigitalTibetan/DigitalTibetan/issues)
- For larger contributions, [Github pull-requests](https://github.com/DigitalTibetan/DigitalTibetan/pulls) are welcome!

The Github-icon on the top right gives easy access to the source-repository and has a quick-edit option. Each edit will be reviewed, so there is no danger of generating a mess. Documents use the [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) format.

This site is based on a [github repository](https://github.com/DigitalTibetan/DigitalTibetan) that basically consists of simple text-files in markdown. The markdown files are converted into this web site using [Jupyter-Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/index.html).
