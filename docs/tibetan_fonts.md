# Tibetan fonts

Tibetan fonts are difficult to produce due to the unlimited number of possible glyphs. While there are only a well defined set of 'standard' Tibetan syllables, there exists many extensions because of Sanskrit transliterations (e.g. mantras), Chinese transliterations, and Dzongkha shortcuts. Due to all of those extensions, it is virtually impossible to generate a 'complete' Tibetan font by providing all possible glyphs.

Microsoft had develop a system that could dynamically render new glyph variants, but the resulting Himalaya font doesn't work on non-Windows platforms and lacks the esthetics of preconceived glyphs. 

So Tibetan fonts either look artificial or are incomplete...

The following list contains a number of fonts with good coverage of the most common glyphs and open licenses.
