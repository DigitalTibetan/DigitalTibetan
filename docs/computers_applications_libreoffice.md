# LibreOffice and Tibetan text

## Configuration

Make sure that you have a suitable [Tibetan font](tibetan_fonts.md) installed.

Select LibreOffice `Preferences...`, two settings have to be adapted for Tibetan:

Under `Language settings, Language`, make sure that `Complex text layout` is ticked, and that one of the Tibetan language flavours is selected.

Once this is configure (hit `Apply`!), a new option is available at `LibreOfficeWriter, Basic Fonts (CTL). Here select a Tibetan font that is actually installed (e.g. from [Tibetan fonts](tibetan_fonts.md)).
