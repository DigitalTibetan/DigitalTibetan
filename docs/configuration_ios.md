# How to configure Apple iOS (iPhone, iPad) for Tibetan

Apple iOS comes with a Tibetan font and can display Tibetan in all apps without any configuration. 

## Tibetan keyboard on mobile

In order to type Tibetan, configure an additional input method for Tibetan:

* Start the `Settings` app.
* Select `General`, `Keyboard`, `Keyboards`, `Add New Keyboard...`
* Search for `Tibetan`, 'Other iPhone keyboard' will now offer to install a Tibetan keyboard.
* `Keyboards` should now display at least two keyboards: your default input method and `Tibetan`.

### iPad with hardware keyboard

If you are using an iPad with an additional hardware keyboard, an additional step is required:

In the `Settings` app:

* Select `General`, `Keyboard`, `Hardware keyboard`. If you have correctly configure the Tibetan input method above, then you can now select the type of input method that is used for the hardware keyboard.
* Select `Tibetan`, and activate `Tibetan - Wylie`.

An iPad with hardware keyboard works now very much like a laptop with Tibetan support.
