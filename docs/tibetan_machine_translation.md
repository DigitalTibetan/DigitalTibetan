## Overview

Tibetan translation is now for the most part an almost solved problem (2025-12-11). Especially the Gemini 3.0 model can deliver good-quality raw translations of Dharma-Tibetan.

Models like Gemini 3.0 now can translate entire treatises in one go. The translations are Dharma-context aware, and while not without mistakes, can produce a fast raw translation of large corpora. However, proof-reading and human editing is still required!
