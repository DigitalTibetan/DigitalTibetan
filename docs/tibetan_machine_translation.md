# Machine translation

> **Note:** Research in application of AI on language translation is a very fast moving field. If you have new information that should be part of this collection, please generate an [issue at github](https://github.com/DigitalTibetan/DigitalTibetan/issues).

## Overview

Tibetan translation is now for the most part an almost solved problem (2025-12-11). Especially the Gemini 3.0 model can deliver good-quality raw translations of Dharma-Tibetan.

The example, which failed completely in 2023, is now handled better (with some issues for the first verse, which would require providing the model with some kind of guidance) with the latest Gemini models:

དཀོན་མཆོག་གསུམ་དངོས་བདེ་གཤེགས་རྩ་བ་གསུམ༔<br>
རྩ་རླུང་ཐིག་ལེའི་རང་བཞིན་བྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས༔<br>
ངོ་བོ་རང་བཞིན་ཐུགས་རྗེའི་དཀྱིལ་འཁོར་ལ༔<br>
བྱང་ཆུབ་སྙིང་པོའི་བར་དུ་སྐྱབས་སུ་མཆི༔

### Gemini 3.0 response

The Tibetan text is a traditional Buddhist refuge prayer. Here is the translation into English:

#### 🇬🇧 English Translation

The three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha) are the actual, the three Roots (Guru, Deva, Dakini) are the Sugata (Buddha), 
The nature of tsa, lung, and tiklé is the Bodhicitta (Enlightenment Mind), 
In the Mandala of the Nature, Characteristic, and Compassion, 
I take refuge until I reach the essence of Enlightenment.

## Current status of translation with large language models (LLMs)

Models like Gemini 3.0 now can translate entire treatises in one go. The translations are Dharma-context aware, and while not without mistakes, can produce a fast raw translation of large corpora. However, proof-reading and human editing is still required!
