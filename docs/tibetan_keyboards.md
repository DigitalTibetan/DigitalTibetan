# An overview of different Tibetan keyboards

```{warning}
Keyboards are a primary attack vector on computer integrity. Never, ever install keyboards from unvalidated sources, neither on computer nor on mobile.

Unfortunately there is no single system or standard that's available on all platforms.

[^mondist]: Many mirrors of the monlam installers are circulating, some of them infected with compromising viruses.
[^gboard]: While the Gboard app is available for iOS too, the Tibetan keyboard is not included on iOS.
[^tibq]: The iOS Tibetan keyboard mirrors the layout of Apple macOS's `Tibetan QWERTY` keyboard.
