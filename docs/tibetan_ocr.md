# Optical character recognition (OCR)

## Google drive and Google docs (online OCR)

Excellent progress has been made by Google in automatically converting woodblock pechas into editable text.
The workflow for conversion is:

1. Get a Tibetan pecha or text in PDF format.
2. Upload the PDF file to Google drive (free Google account required)
3. Open the PDF with Google Docs: the PDF will be automatically translated to text, and color marking is used to highlight difficult parts.

### Example

A one-page PDF (you can also use of course multiple pages) is uploaded to Google Drive

The, in Google Drive, open the PDF. You will see a button "Open in Google Docs". Do so, you will get editable text:

Note that even the side-text and page-numbers have been automatically identified!
