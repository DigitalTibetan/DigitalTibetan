| Apple iPhone, iPad | ++ | ++[^1] | Full Tibetan support since iOS 4.21 (2010) |
| Android | ++ | ++ | Full Tibetan support since Android 6.0 (2015) |

[^1]: iOS currently has a bug that sometimes duplicates stacked Tibetan letters during input with Apple's implementation of the Wylie import method. The duplicate letters vanish as soon as a complete syllable is entered. Apple has so far been unable to fix this.
[^2]: Older kindle models (before operating system update 5.9.6) did correctly display Tibetan script. Current version have broken the support for Tibetan. Amazon has so far been unable to fix this.
