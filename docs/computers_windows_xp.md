# How to prepare a Computer running Windows XP for Tibetan Editing

```{warning}
Windows XP is a very old operating system, no longer supported by Microsoft. If your computer is less than 10 years old, you probably want to check the [main Windows article](computers_windows.md)

## Tibetan Unicode enabling Windows XP

### Enabling complex script support

Microsoft Windows XP supports complex scripts, the feature to correctly display Tibetan stacks, only with Microsoft Office 2003 SP1 and later. However it is possible to install support for Tibetan complex scripts for all applications (e.g. Web browsers and OpenOffice).

An excellent description how to update Windows XP can be found at the [National Library of Bhutan](https://web.archive.org/web/20200123024135/http://library.gov.bt/IT/uniscribe.html). (The description is for Dzongkha, but works for Tibetan too.)

## Installing Unicode fonts

Simply install one of the Unicode [Tibetan Fonts](tibetan_fonts.md).

A good start is Tibetan Machine Uni or Jomolhari.

## Installing a Tibetan input method

Follow the instructions at [Windows, Tibetan keyboards](keyboard_tise). It's recommended to use the old release 1.99 of TISE, which can be downloaded [here](https://tise.mokhin.org/tise.zip). Check the [TISE site](https://tise.mokhin.org/) for more information.

Additionally,

THDL gives a comprehensive overview on different existing [Tibetan Input Methods].
A good start is TISE, a Wylie input method for Windows XP and Vista.
A number of different keyboards including a Wylie keyboard are available from Tibetan Portal, download Keyman keyboards.
For an introduction on how to type Wylie with TISE, check: Tibetan Input Method for Windows.
You can directly start using Notepad, OpenOffice or the latest Microsoft Office version to create Tibetan documents in standard Unicode encoding.
